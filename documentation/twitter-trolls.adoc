== Russian Twitter Trolls

++++
<div class="col-lg-4">
++++

As part of the House Intelligence Committee investigation into *how Russia may have influenced the 2016 US Election*, Twitter released the screen names of almost 3000 Twitter accounts believed to be connected to Russia's Internet Research Agency, a company known for operating *social media troll accounts*. Twitter immediately suspended these accounts, deleting their data from Twitter.com and the Twitter API. 

A team at NBC News including link:https://twitter.com/bpopken[Ben Popken^] and link:https://twitter.com/mrejfox[EJ Fox^] was able to reconstruct a dataset consisting of  a subset of the deleted data for their investigation and using Neo4j were able to link:https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/russian-trolls-went-attack-during-key-election-moments-n827176[show how these troll accounts went on attack during key election moments.^] *NBC News open-sourced the reconstructed dataset* and released it as this Neo4j database.

== The Datamodel

++++
<div class="col-lg-4">
++++

Neo4j uses the labeled property graph datamodel to represent data. 

=== Nodes

Nodes can have one or more *node labels* to describe the "type" of the node.

* *Tweet* - The Tweet
* *User* - A Twitter user
* *Troll* - An optional node label to identify users that are on the House list of Russian troll accounts
* *Hashtag* - Any hashtags used in the tweet
* *Source* - The Twitter application used to post the tweet
* *URL* - A link embedded in a tweet

++++
</div>
++++

++++
<div class="col-lg-3">
++++
=== Relationships

Relationships have a single *relationship type*.

* *POSTED* - Connects the `Tweet` with the User who posted it
* *MENTIONS* - Connects any Users that are `@-mentioned` to the `Tweet`
* *HAS_TAG* - Connect a `Tweet` to any `Hashtag` nodes included in the tweet
* *POSTED_VIA* - Connects a `Tweet` to its `Source` application node
* *RETWEETED* - Connects a `Tweet` that retweets another `Tweet`
* *IN_REPLY_TO* - Connects a `Tweet` that is a reply to another `Tweet`

== Introduction To Cypher

++++
<div class="col-lg-5">
++++

In order to work with our labeled property graph, we need a query language for graphs. 

=== Graph Patterns

Cypher is the query language for graphs and is centered around *graph patterns*. Graph patterns are expressed in Cypher using ASCII-art like syntax.

*Nodes* are defined within parentheses `()`. Optionally, we can specify node label(s): `(:User)`

*Relationships* are defined within square brackets `[]`. Optionally we can specify type and direction:

`(:Tweet)**+<-[:POSTED]-+**(:User)`

Graph elements can be bound to *aliases* that can be referred to later in the query:

`(**t**:Tweet)+<-+[**r**:POSTED]-(**u**:User)`

=== Predicates

Filters can be applied to these graph patterns to limit the matching paths. Boolean logic operators, regular expressions and string comparison operators can be used here.

Be sure to use the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/current/?ref=browser-guide[Cypher Refcard] as a reference for learning Cypher syntax.

=== Dissecting a Cypher Statement
Let's look at a Cypher query that answers the question "For Users with over 1000 followers, how many tweets did they post?". Don't worry if this seems complex, we'll build up our understanding of Cypher as we move along. 

.Click on the block to put the query in the top-most window on the query editor. Hit the triangular icon:play-circle[] button or press kbd:[Ctrl+Enter] to run it and see the resulting visualization.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[r1:POSTED]->(t:Tweet)
WHERE u.followers_count > 1000
WITH COUNT(t) AS num
RETURN num
----

== Querying The Graph - Overview


++++
<div class="col-lg-6">
++++

Neo4j Browser is an interactive query workbench tool for executing Cypher queries in Neo4j and working with the results in both graph visualization and tabular forms.

=== Graph Results

If our Cypher query returns graph objects (Nodes, Relationships, Paths) then Neo4j Browser will render a graph visualization for us to explore.

=== Tabular Results

Often the answer to our question however is tabular data - for example, the result of running an aggregation. We can also return rows of scalar values in Cypher. In that case Neo4j Browser will render a table of rows.

.Find tweets with the hashtag `thanksobama`
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:POSTED]->(t:Tweet)-[:HAS_TAG]->(ht:Hashtag {tag: "thanksobama"})
RETURN * LIMIT 50
----

.Overview query. What are the node labels in the graphs and how many of each?
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (t) 
RETURN LABELS(t), COUNT(*) AS count
ORDER BY count DESC
----

++++
</div>
++++

== Querying The Graph - Users

A simple type of query we can run is one that matches on a single node label. In this database we've added the node label `Troll` to any users that show up on the House list of Russian Twitter Trolls. 

We can search for the Trolls with the most followers:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:Troll) WHERE EXISTS(u.followers_count)
RETURN u.screen_name AS screen_name, u.followers_count AS followers
ORDER BY followers DESC LIMIT 50
----

Or use an aggregation function like `COUNT()` to see the most popular locations that Troll users list in their profiles:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:Troll) 
RETURN u.location, COUNT(u) AS num 
ORDER BY num DESC LIMIT 100
----

Or use a predicate filter to search for a specific Troll by screen name:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:Troll)
WHERE u.screen_name = "LeroyLovesUSA"
RETURN u
----


== Querying The Graph - Tweets

We can specify more complex graph patterns using Cypher to search for users plus the tweets they've posted, and even the hashtags that those tweets contain.

++++
<div class="col-lg-7">
++++

.Tweets posted by the user LeroyLovesUSA with the hashtag thanksobama
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:POSTED]->(t:Tweet)-[:HAS_TAG]->(ht:Hashtag {tag: "thanksobama"})
WHERE u.screen_name = "LeroyLovesUSA"
RETURN *
----

We can include predicates to filter for paths matching the pattern and our predicates:

.Find tweets posted by Troll accounts that contain the word fraud
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t:Troll)-[:POSTED]->(tw:Tweet) 
WHERE tw.text CONTAINS "fraud"
OPTIONAL MATCH p=(tw)-[:HAS_TAG|HAS_LINK|MENTIONS|IN_REPLY_TO]-(a)
RETURN * LIMIT 50

.Query for tweet volume by day

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Troll)-[:POSTED]->(t:Tweet) WHERE t.created_str > "2016-10-01"
RETURN substring(t.created_str,0,10) AS day,
  COUNT(t) AS num ORDER BY day LIMIT 60
----

.Query for tweet volume by month

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Troll)-[:POSTED]->(t:Tweet)
RETURN substring(t.created_str,0,7) AS month,
  COUNT(t) AS num ORDER BY month DESC LIMIT 25
----

We can see that much of the tweet volume occurs leading up to and immediately following the 2016 US Election.

== Hashtags

++++
<div class="col-lg-9">
++++

Hashtags were used by the trolls to insert themselves into conversations and gain visibility.

.What are the most common hashtags used by the trolls?
[source,cypher]

WITH ht, COUNT(tw) AS num ORDER BY num DESC
RETURN ht.tag AS hashtag, num LIMIT 10

WITH t,substring(t.created_str,0,10) AS day, [(t)-[:HAS_TAG]->(ht:Hashtag) | ht.tag] AS tags
UNWIND tags AS tag
WITH day, tag, COUNT(t) AS num ORDER BY num DESC
RETURN day, COLLECT(tag)[..5] AS toptags ORDER BY day

This streamgraph from the link:https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/russian-trolls-went-attack-during-key-election-moments-n827176[NBC News article^] shows hashtag volume by category.

++++
</div>
++++


== Hashtags - `#RejectedDebateTopics`

=== `@WordOfHashtags`

One of the hashtags used by the Trolls was `#RejectedDebateTopics`. The Troll account `@WorldOfHashtags` used it as a way to annouce a "hashtag game" to encourage others to use the same hashtag. Hundreds of non-troll accounts ended up interacting with this acocount by using the `#RejectedDebateTopics` hashtag.

.What are the tweets posted by `@WorldOfHashtags` with the hashtag `#RejectedDebateTopics` ?
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:Troll {screen_name: "WorldOfHashtags"})-[:POSTED]->(t:Tweet)-[:HAS_TAG]->(:Hashtag {tag: "rejecteddebatetopics"})
WHERE t.created_str > "2016-10-01"
RETURN t.text, t.created_str
ORDER BY t.created_at LIMIT 50
----

== Tweet Sources Used

A variety of applications were used by the Troll accounts for posting tweets.

.What are the common sources used for posting tweets?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Troll)-[:POSTED]->(tw:Tweet)-[:POSTED_VIA]->(s:Source)
RETURN s.name AS source, COUNT(tw) AS tweets
ORDER BY tweets DESC 
----

== Original Content vs Replies and Retweets

Tweets can be retweets of other tweets or "original content" tweets that do not reference other tweets. Many of the Troll tweets are retweets and replies. We can filter out these retweets and replies and search only for "original content" tweets.

.Find original content tweets posted by user @TEN_GOP

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH p=(t:Troll {user_key: "ten_gop"})-[:POSTED]->(tw:Tweet)
WHERE NOT EXISTS((tw)-[:RETWEETED|IN_REPLY_TO]->(:Tweet))
OPTIONAL MATCH (ht:Hashtag)<-[:HAS_TAG]-(tw)
OPTIONAL MATCH (u:User)<-[:MENTIONS]-(tw)
RETURN p,ht,u LIMIT 25
----

== Inferred Relationships

++++
<div class="col-lg-9">
++++

Inferred relationships are important in graphs. For example, when a Troll account retweets another Troll's tweet we could say the trolls have an inferred *"AMPLIFIED"* relationship: one troll is amplifying the message of the other.

.Inferred AMPLIFIED relationships exist when a troll account retweets another troll
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH p=(r1:Troll)-[:POSTED]->(:Tweet)<-[:RETWEETED]-(:Tweet)<-[:POSTED]-(r2:Troll)
RETURN p LIMIT 1

== Graph Algorithms

++++
<div class="col-lg-9">
++++

link:https://neo4j.com/graph-analytics/[Graph algorithms^] are a way to apply analytics to the entire graph to further enhance our understanding of the data. These algorithms fall into three categories: 

* **Centrality** - What are the most important nodes in the network? _PageRank, Betweenness Centrality, Closeness Centrality_
* **Community detection** - How can the graph be partitioned? _Union Find, Louvain, Label Propagation, Connected Components_
* **Pathfinding** - What are the shortest paths or best routes available given cost? _Minimum Weight Spanning Tree, All Pairs- and Single Source- Shortest Path, Dijkstra_

We can run these algorithms in Neo4j with Cypher using the link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms[Neo4j Graph Algorithms^] procedures.

== Centrality

++++
<div class="col-lg-9">
++++

Let's run PageRank over this inferred AMPLIFIED graph to find the most influential trolls

To do that, we first project this graph into memory and then run our algorithms on top of that.

[source,cypher]
----
call gds.graph.project.cypher('amplified',
"MATCH (t:Troll) RETURN id(t) AS id", 
"MATCH (r1:Troll)-[:POSTED]->(:Tweet)<-[:RETWEETED]-(:Tweet)<-[:POSTED]-(r2:Troll) RETURN id(r2) as source, id(r1) as target, count(*) as weight",{})
----

.Run PageRank over the inferred troll amplification graph. This will write the results back to a pagerank property on the nodes
[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.pageRank.write('amplified', {writeProperty:'pagerank'})
----

.Find Trolls with highest PageRank score
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t:Troll) WHERE EXISTS(t.pagerank)
RETURN t.screen_name AS troll, t.pagerank AS pagerank ORDER BY pagerank DESC LIMIT 25
----

.What are the top trolls tweeting about?
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t:Troll) WHERE EXISTS(t.pagerank)
WITH t ORDER BY t.pagerank LIMIT 25
MATCH (t)-[:POSTED]->(tw:Tweet)-[:HAS_TAG]-(ht:Hashtag)
RETURN ht.tag, COUNT(tw) AS num ORDER BY num DESC LIMIT 25
----

++++
</div>
++++

++++
<div class="col-lg-3">
++++

[subs=attributes]
++++
<img src="{img}/pagerank.png" class="img-responsive">
++++

PageRank is a recursive graph algorithm that defines the importance of a node proportional to the importance and number of connected nodes in the graph.

++++
</div>
++++

== Community Detection

++++
<div class="col-lg-9">
++++

We can also run community detection over this inferred AMPLIFIED graph to see how the graph is partitioned

.Partition the graph into communities using the Label Propagation algorithm. An additional property `community` is added to each node specifying the community it has been assgined to by the algorithm.
[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.labelPropagation.write('amplified', {writeProperty:'partition', relationshipWeightProperty:'weight'});
----

We can then see which Trolls were assigned to each community:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t:Troll) WHERE EXISTS(t.partition)
RETURN COLLECT(t.screen_name) AS members, t.partition AS community
ORDER BY SIZE(members) DESC LIMIT 10
----

And finally, we can see if there are certain themes that each community was focused on, by inspecting the most common hashtags used by each community:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t:Troll) WHERE EXISTS(t.partition)
WITH COLLECT(t) AS members, t.partition AS community
ORDER BY SIZE(members) DESC LIMIT 10
UNWIND members AS t
MATCH (t)-[:POSTED]->(tw:Tweet)-[:HAS_TAG]->(ht:Hashtag)
WITH community, ht.tag AS tag, COUNT(tw) AS num ORDER BY num DESC
RETURN community, COLLECT(tag)[..10] AS toptags
LIMIT 10

=== Ideas

We've only just begun to explore the data. Here are some ideas for further data analysis:

* Location
* Entity extraction
* Temporal data analysis (are tweets posted at a certain time of day?)
* Clustering the graph
* Exploring most co-mentioned users and hashtags
